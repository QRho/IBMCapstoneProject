    "#### Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Amsterdam is one of the most multicultural citys that I know of and according to \n",
    "According to wiki (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam) Ampsterdam is \"The Dutch capital is considered one of the most multicultural cities in the world, with at least 177 nationalities represented.\" it is also a huge tourist destination and boasted that \"In the early years of the 21st century, the Amsterdam city centre has attracted large numbers of tourists: between 2012 and 2015, the annual number of visitors rose from 10 to 17 million.\" This city has always had a huge draw for me for its ties to being an artistic world center and this short study will be using geo location and stat data to determine what location in Ampsterdam would be the best spot to open a resturant. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Specific Considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "The very basic and more universal areas of attention when starting a retail or resturant business are the same. \n",
    "Before looking at things like theme, style and menu the essentials that can determine weather a business is doomed to fail or ready to succeed are as follows and this wisdom comes from an internal real estate source is firstly location, location, location. (https://bit.ly/2KXWrfo) Supplimental info from Gormetmarketing.net. \n",
    "Location consideration comes with the idea of assuring a certain amount of traffic and when we start talking about traffic it is also important to consider parking considerations. Weather the parking is provided on a civic level such as public parking garages etc, parking is an important consideration. \n",
    "In addition to being visible in the physical sense online visibility, review sites and social opinion are important to consider.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data used:\n",
    "\n",
    "Stats about netherlands in general and including Ampsterdam from https://opendata.cbs.nl/#/CBS/en/, more specifically\n",
    "https://bit.ly/3osVsRY.\n",
    "Foursquare API location data that contains lat and longitude as well as other info.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Needed:\n",
    "To solve this problem I will need to scrape or otherswise find the names, locations of neighborhoods in Amsterdam along with carparks and public transportation hubs. Foursquare location data can show us proximities and help us narrow our search to a accomidating area in which to start a thriving resturant business in Amsterdam. \n"
